1 Overview
**********

The documented and supported method to build MP4v2 uses the GNU build
system (also known as the Autotools). You must first obtain the sources
by either downloading and extracting the source-distribution bundle or
working directly MP4v2's Subversion repository. We have build documents
for both methods, but unless you are a member of the MP4v2 project, you
are strongly encouraged to use the source-distribution method.

On other supported platforms which lack Autotools we provide an
alternative method for building the software. Please see the
appropriate platform section.

2 Introduction
**************

This document describes the recommended process to build MP4v2 from the
repository. This process is a superset of the process to build from a
source-distribution bundle.  If you are interested in building from a
source-distribution bundle then this document is not for you.

3 Quickstart
************

This chapter is for the impatient or those just looking for a quick
summary of all the commands used in a typical build. You may skip this
summary and jump to *note Build Process::.

     svn checkout https://mp4v2.googlecode.com/svn/releases/1.9.1 mp4v2
     cd mp4v2
     autoreconf -fiv
     rm -fr build/
     mkdir build/
     cd build/
     ../configure
     make
     make install
     make install-man
     make dist

4 Build Process
***************

4.1 Checkout Sources
====================

Checkout sources from the project's Subversion repository.

Sources are checked out from either the trunk, release or a branch.
This document was generated from one of those, and for example
purposes, we will use exactly the same URL which used to create the
distribution which contains this document.

If you are a project member, then you may add the appropriate
login/password information as needed.

     svn checkout https://mp4v2.googlecode.com/svn/releases/1.9.1 mp4v2
     cd mp4v2

It is recommended to use Subversion 1.5.0 or higher.  Lower versions
might work.

4.2 Boostrap (Autotools)
========================

The following command causes forces Autotools to regenerate all files
and install helper scripts needed at configure-time and to regenerate
all files.

     autoreconf -fiv

If you are a project member and preparing for a release, it is
important to note that the versions of Autotools available in your path
will directly effect files added to the bundle. At the time of writing,
the following versions of Autotools are recommended; in some cases a
minimum is hard-coded and warnings will be issued if in violation:

   * GNU autoconf 2.61 or higher (lower versions might work)

   * GNU automake 1.10 or higher (lower versions might work)

   * GNU libtool 1.5.26 or higher (lower versions might work)

4.3 Configure
=============

The following command configures the project for a build.  It is highly
recommended that you invoke configure from an empty directory.

     rm -fr build/
     mkdir build/
     cd build/
     ../configure

Please see `INSTALL' for details on configure usage, and standard
options. Additionally, the following custom options have been added to
`configure':

`--disable-debug'
     Do not generate debug information.  Do not direct compiler to
     generate debugging information. By default the compiler will
     generate debug information if the platform supports it.

`--disable-optimize'
     Do not optimize. Do not direct compiler to optimize code. By
     default compiler optimization is enabled if the platform supports
     it.

`--disable-fvisibility'
     Do not set default ELF symbol visibility. By default configure
     attempts to detect if the compiler supports this feature. However
     on some platforms detecting incompatibilty of this feature might
     not be accurate in which case this option should be given.

`--disable-gch'
     By default certain platforms are marked to use GCC precompiled
     headers. Generally this greatly decrease build times but may
     require more diligence for iterative development; that is to say
     dependencies may not properly be tracked and more frequent `make
     clean' may be required when headers are changed. Use this option
     to disable GCC precompiled headers.

`--disable-largefile'
     On some 32-bit platforms or configurations it might be desirable
     to build without largefile (LFS) support. By default configure
     attempts to detect formal LFS support and enables it if found.

`--disable-util'
     Do not build/install utilities. This is convenience option for
     users who desire to skip building the utilities (eg. command-line
     executables) which are enabled by default.

`--enable-bi=ARCH'
     On bi-arch capable platforms it is possible to generate 32 or 64
     bit code. This is supported by adding arguments `-m32' or `-m64',
     respectively, when compiling or linking. Use this option to
     override the platform-specific default.

`--enable-ub[=ARCHS]'
     On OSX systems it is possible to generate universal binaries. This
     is supported by adding one or more argument patterns `-arch ARCH'
     when compiling or linking. Use this option to either target an
     architecture different from the platform default, or to produce
     universal binaries.

`--enable-dependency-tracking'
     Enable automatic dependency tracking for include-files. By default
     this feature is disabled.


4.4 Build
=========

The following command will build MP4v2.

     make

On some platforms `make' refers to a BSD-flavor of make which is not
compatible with this project. Check if `gmake' is installed, and if it
is, substitute `gmake' wherever you may see `make' in this document.
Otherwise you will need to install GNU make package version 3.81 or
higher. Lower versions might work.

4.5 Install
===========

The following command will install MP4v2.

     make install
     make install-man

4.6 Create Distribution
=======================

The following command will create a MP4v2 source distribution. It is
during this step that shipped documentation is generated.

     make dist

This step in the build process introduces additional requirements to
the host system. While most of the following utilities are generally
available, `help2man' is used to generate man-pages; however if this
command is not available the man-pages will be empty. This is
acceptable for non-release builds but for full quality builds this
command is required.

   * GNU help2man 1.36 or higher (lower versions should work)

   * GNU tar 1.15.1 or higher (lower versions should work)

   * GNU gzip 1.3.10 or higher (lower versions should work)

   * bzip2 1.0.4 or higher (lower versions should work)

   * Info-ZIP zip 2.32 or higher (lower versions should work)

4.7 Build Documentation
=======================

This step in the build process introduces some significant requirements
to the host system:

   * GNU texinfo 4.8 or higher (lower versions should work)

   * Doxygen 1.5.7 or higher (lower versions should work)

Documentation that is shipped with source-distribution is generated as
part of the *note Build Process:: step. This section documents builds
all of the supported methods to build documentation. There are three
kinds of documentation in this project; man-pages, articles and API.
Documentation must be build from the repository.

Man-pages are automatically generated for command-line utilities by
using `html2man' which invokes standard options `--help' and
`--version' and gleans the information, generating a man-page in nroff
script. Note that the utilities will first be built as they are
depdendencies of man-page generation.

Artcles are usually hand-written and authored in Texinfo format which
permits macro-expansions, simple formatting and conversion to several
popular formats using the GNU `makeinfo'. A Texinfo manual
(http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo) is available.

API is documented inline to C and C++ source files, usually headers
using Doxygen comment-formatting. Doxygen is then used to post-process
these files and generate documentation in various formats. A Doxygen
manual is available at it's main site (http://www.doxygen.org) .

The project's goal is to document as thoroughly as possible the public
API in MP4v2. Since we never have enough time to document everything,
we try to set some priorities in this regard. Generally the public API
is the highest priority to document. Next most important is probably
underlying utility code which is shared by many developers; for example
libplatform.

If you need examples of how to document C-compatible source see
`include/mp4v2/mp4v2.h' and for C++-only source see
`libplatform/io/File.h' .

The following table describes the various make targets available for
building docs. Note you must first have completed the *note Configure::
step.

`make man'
     Generate man-pages for command-line utilities.

`make html'
     Generate articles in HTML format from `texi' files.

`make txt'
     Generate articles in plaintext format from `texi' files.

`make wiki'
     Generate articles in Google Code Wiki format from `texi' files.

`make xml'
     Generate articles in (Texinfo) XML format from `texi' files.

`make api'
     Generate API in HTML format from header files.

`make articles'
     Convenience; the equivalent of `make html txt wiki xml' .

`make doc'
     Convenience; the equivalent of `make man articles api' .


And finally all of the document targets have a corresponding clean
target which cleans up generated files. Simply prefix as follows:

     make manclean
     make htmlclean
     make txtclean
     make wikiclean
     make xmlclean
     make apiclean
     make articlesclean
     make docclean

4.8 Post Site and API Documentation to project website.
=======================================================

This step is for project maintainers and can be used to update Site and
API documentation. The following components are updated:

   * Featured Wiki article: BuildRepository

   * Featured Wiki article: BuildSource

   * MP4v2 (trunk) docs (includes Release Notes and other articles, and
     API docs).

This procedure may only be run from a *nix platform and has only been
tested on Mac OS X.

`make google.clean'
     Clean any local working copy of google changeset.

`make google.post'
     Generate required docs, sparse-checkout google tree, remove files
     which are no longer generated, add new files which are generated,
     and update existing files.

`svn ci -m "-refreshed GoogleCode site+api docs." google/.'
     Check-in changes. This might take several minutes, especially if
     your upstream bandwidth is limited.


5 Platform Notes
****************

MP4v2 builds on many unix-style platforms, also commonly referred to as
posix-style systems. Building on Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris,
Cygwin, Windows are known to work.

Similar platforms should also work. Please see the following platform
specific notes for instructions on commonly used options for various
platforms.

5.1 Mac OS X
============

Building on Mac OS X is well supported as it is used by maintainers of
this project. The following are the recommended specifications for this
platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is
possible:

   * Mac Intel hardware

   * Mac OS X 10.5.7

   * Xcode-3.1.2

   * gcc 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)

   * gcc 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5570)

     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled
     compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom
     compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime
     requirements for your users. There are of course many valid
     reasons to build with unbundled compilers, but be aware that is
     generally unsupported and left as an exercise to the reader.

5.1.1 Default Binaries
----------------------

The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure
without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce
static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.

     ../configure

5.1.2 Release Binaries
----------------------

The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie.
which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to
configure:

     ../configure --disable-debug

5.1.3 Developer Binaries
------------------------

The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to
pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however
for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no
static libraries.

     ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static

5.1.4 Universal Binaries - all architectures
--------------------------------------------

The preferred method to produce universal binaries for all supported
architectures is to pass the following option to configure. As of this
writing, architectures { i386, x86_64, ppc, ppc64 } are built.

     ../configure --enable-ub

5.1.5 Universal Binaries - selected architectures
-------------------------------------------------

The preferred method to produce universal binaries for selected
architectures is to specify a comma-delimited list specifying the
desired architecture identifiers. Passing the following option will
produce universal binaries for architectures { i386, x86_64 }.

     ../configure --enable-ub=i386,x86_64

5.2 Linux
=========

Building on Linux is well supported as it is used by maintainers of
this project. The following are the recommended specifications for this
platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is
possible:

   * Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware

   * Fedora 10, gcc 4.3.2

   * gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work

     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled
     compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom
     compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime
     requirements for your users. There are of course many valid
     reasons to build with unbundled compilers, but be aware that is
     generally unsupported and left as an exercise to the reader.

5.2.1 Default Binaries
----------------------

The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure
without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce
static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.

     ../configure

5.2.2 Release Binaries
----------------------

The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie.
which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to
configure:

     ../configure --disable-debug

5.2.3 Developer Binaries
------------------------

The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to
pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however
for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no
static libraries.

     ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static

5.2.4 Bi-arch compilation
-------------------------

The preferred method to produce a bi-arch binary is to specify the
target (eg. 32-bit) with the following option to configure. This
example will produce a 32-bit binary if compiling on a platform which
defaults to producing 64-bit binaries. The inverse is also possible.

     ../configure --enable-bi=32

     Warning: Currently bi-arch cross-compilation is not supported due
     to a bug with libtool which fails miserably during linking.

5.3 FreeBSD
===========

Building on FreeBSD is supported. The following are the recommended
specifications for this platform; but is not necessarily the only
configuration that is possible:

   * Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware

   * FreeBSD 7.0 Release, gcc 4.2.1

   * gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work

     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled
     compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom
     compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime
     requirements for your users. There are of course many valid
     reasons to build with unbundled compilers, but be aware that is
     generally unsupported and left as an exercise to the reader.

5.3.1 Default Binaries
----------------------

The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure
without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce
static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.

     ../configure

5.3.2 Release Binaries
----------------------

The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie.
which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to
configure:

     ../configure --disable-debug

5.3.3 Developer Binaries
------------------------

The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to
pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however
for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no
static libraries.

     ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static

5.3.4 Bi-arch compilation
-------------------------

The preferred method to produce a bi-arch binary is to specify the
target (eg. 32-bit) with the following option to configure. This
example will produce a 32-bit binary if compiling on a platform which
defaults to producing 64-bit binaries. The inverse is also possible.

     ../configure --enable-bi=32

     Warning: Currently bi-arch cross-compilation is not supported due
     to a bug with libtool which fails miserably during linking.

5.4 Solaris
===========

Building on Solaris is supported. The following are the recommended
specifications for this platform; but is not necessarily the only
configuration that is possible:

   * Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware

   * Solaris 10u6, gcc 3.4.3

   * gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work

     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled
     compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom
     compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime
     requirements for your users. There are of course many valid
     reasons to build with unbundled compilers, but be aware that is
     generally unsupported and left as an exercise to the reader.

     Note: Solaris does not (yet) really bundle a compiler. The
     recommendation is to use the companion-disk compiler for maximum
     C++ runtime compatibility. It is usually found in `/usr/sfw/bin'.

5.4.1 Default Binaries
----------------------

The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure
without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce
static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.

     ../configure

5.4.2 Release Binaries
----------------------

The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie.
which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to
configure:

     ../configure --disable-debug

5.4.3 Developer Binaries
------------------------

The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to
pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however
for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no
static libraries.

     ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static

5.4.4 Bi-arch compilation
-------------------------

The preferred method to produce a bi-arch binary is to specify the
target (eg. 32-bit) with the following option to configure. This
example will produce a 32-bit binary if compiling on a platform which
defaults to producing 64-bit binaries. The inverse is also possible.

     ../configure --enable-bi=32

     Warning: Currently bi-arch cross-compilation is not supported due
     to a bug with libtool which fails miserably during linking.

5.5 Cygwin
==========

Building on Cygwin is supported. The following are the recommended
specifications for this platform; but is not necessarily the only
configuration that is possible:

   * Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware

   * Cygwin, gcc 4.3.2

   * gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work

     Note: As of this writing, Cygwin has available to it several
     versions of gcc; only one of which may be found and used in the
     path as `gcc' and `g++'. Configure will thus find what is probably
     the older more stable version of gcc in a typical Cygwin
     environment. If you desire to build with the newer gcc, it is
     found in the path as `gcc-4' and `g++-4' respectively and you must
     indicate to configure the desired versions. Defining the following
     variables beforing running configure should do the trick:

     setenv CC gcc-4
     setenv CXX gcc-4
     ../configure

5.5.1 Default Binaries
----------------------

The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure
without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce
static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.

     ../configure

5.5.2 Release Binaries
----------------------

The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie.
which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to
configure:

     ../configure --disable-debug

5.5.3 Developer Binaries
------------------------

The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to
pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however
for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no
static libraries.

     ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static

5.6 Windows
===========

Native builds on Windows is supported via Microsoft's Visual Studio
package. Both the commercial version and free version (express) are
known to work. The following are the recommended specifications for
this platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is
possible:

   * Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware

   * Windows 2000 or higher, Visual Studio 9.0 (aka. Visual Studio 2008)

   * Visual Studio 9.0 Express is reported to work

Only 32-bit binaries are targeted, and win32-API is set to Windows 2000
or higher. Older versions of Windows, or win32-API are not supported.

MP4v2 has directory `vstudio9.0/' which contains the necessary
solution+project files to produce a basic build of libmp4v2's DLL and
several command-line executables. Enabling things such as debugging,
optimization, etc, are all left as an exercise to the user.

     Warning: Project meta-data is stored in header `project.h'. A
     proper source distribution is built using autotools and generates
     `TOP/include/mp4v2/project.h' correctly, which is then bundled
     with our source distribution. This is adequate for building on the
     Windows platform.

     However, if you are building from the repository, be warned that
     there is no method to automatically generate `project.h' on
     Windows. Instead, we periodically checkin a copy of this file
     (generated using autotools) as
     `vstudio9.0/include/mp4v2/project.h' which may from time to time
     get out of date. If it is significantly out of date, you should
     find the latest source distribution and copy the `project.h' from
     there.
