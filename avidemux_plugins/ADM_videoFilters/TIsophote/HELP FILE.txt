INFO:


      TIsophote is a level-set (isophote) smoothing filter.  It does simple unconstrained level-set
   smoothing.  Basically, it can smooth jagged edges in an image.  If over used it will remove jagged 
   edges as well as object features and eventually completely eliminate all level curves. For a more 
   in-depth explanation see the technical info towards the bottom of the help file.

   Syntax =>    TIsophote(int iterations, float tStep, int type, bool chroma)



PARAMETERS:


   iterations
  
      Sets the number of iterations used.  More iterations will take more processing time.
      Increasing the number of iterations while holding tStep constant will result in more and
      more shortening of the level curves.  Total 'time' of the filter is equal to -
      iterations*tStep. iterations must be set to at least 1.

      default -  4  (int)


   tStep

      Sets the update per iteration.  At 1.0, each iteration is a full cycle of the flow equation.
      At 0, the original image is always returned.  Generally, lower values produce more "stable"
      flow but require more iterations.  Recommended values are between 0.1 and 0.5, though setting
      this to 1.0 is usually ok and simply results in an extra overall smoothing.  While this
      value can be anything, it really only makes sense when it is 0.0 <= tStep <= 1.0, other values
      will generally result in garbage output.  This setting could be seen as a strength of smoothing
      per iteration setting (1.0 being strongest, 0.0 being nothing).  Note:  technically for long run
      numerical stability this value must be less then 0.25!

      default -  0.2  (float)


   type

      Sets how the needed derivatives are calculated.

         type 0 - simplest possible estimate of both first and second derivatives 
                  (fastest, probably best clean video)

         type 1 - sobel operator for first derivatives, simple estimate for second
                  (in-between 0 and 2 speed wise and noise wise)

         type 2 - sobel operator for first and similar inherent denoising operator for second
                  (slowest, probably best for noisy video)   
  
      default -  2 (int)


   chroma

      If set to true the chroma planes are processed.  If set to false the chroma planes from the
      source are simply copied to the output frame.

      default - false  (bool)
   


TECHNICAL INFO:


   The filter operation is really quite simple, all it does is use the following equation to update the 
   value of each pixel in the frame after each iteration.

    I(n) = a pixel in the frame at iteration n

    I(n+1) = I(n) + It

    It = ((Ix*Ix*Iyy + 2*Ix*Iy*Ixy + Iy*Iy*Ixx) * tStep) / (Ix*Ix + Iy*Iy + e)

        - e = a very small constant (ex. 10^-10) to prevent division by 0
        - Ix, Iy, Ixy, Iyy, Ixx are the first and second derivatives of
          the image at the current pixel location, i.e.
             Ix = first derivative in x direction
             Iy = first derivative in y direction, etc...
      


CHANGE LIST:

   07/24/2004  v0.9.1
       - Changed default values for iterations, type, and chroma parameters
       - Fixed incorrect clipping for values below 0.  Pixel values were clipped 
            to 0-255 range but values below 0 were getting clipped to abs(pixel)
            instead of 0 which would lead to artifacts.

   06/25/2004  v0.9
       - Initial Release



TO DO LIST:  

     - bug fixes as needed
