# - Locate the SDL library
# This module defines
#  SDL_LIBRARY, the library to link against
#  SDL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
#  SDL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h
#
# Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project for the 
# OS X framework based version. (Other versions link to -lSDLmain which
# this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this 
# module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.
# $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR
# used in building SDL.
# l.e.galup  9-20-02
#
# Modified by Eric Wing. 
# Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and 
# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc). 
# Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL guidelines.
# Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some platforms.
# Added a search for threads which is needed by some platforms.
# Added needed compile switches for MinGW.
#
# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of 
# SDL_LIBRARY to override this selection.
#
# Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h
# This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention
# is #include "SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>. This is done for portability
# reasons because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).
